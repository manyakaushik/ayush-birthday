`Hi baby,
Today you filed a complaint.
And I just filed a counter one:
“How does one man have this much power over my heart?”

I’m sorry if I missed a moment — if I let a second pass without making you feel like you’re my everything.
You deserve more than just apologies. You deserve warmth in words, affection in actions, and kisses between all the pauses.
I am here to make it up to you in the ways I know best — with extra softness, extra time, and extra me.

With kisses on the way,  
Manya 💋`,

`Dear Complainant,
Your ticket has been processed, prioritized, and passed straight to the Department of Regret.

A resolution is being dispatched in the following format:  
• A voice note that melts  
• A picture that seduces  
• And a surprise that makes you smile and say “ufff”

Manya  
(Director of Ayush Affairs) 💼💗`,

`Hi my safe place,
You felt unheard — and I hate that.
You deserve 100% of me, even on tired days, even on chaotic ones.
Because you are not a distraction — you are the anchor.
You aren’t “too much.” You are my exact kind of everything.
Thank you for reminding me that love is in showing up — fully, consistently, softly.

Love from your loudest fan,  
Manya 💘`,

`Dear Ayush,
I’m just gonna say it —  
You being upset is my least favorite version of the world.

Let’s correct that immediately.
An apology is en route. ETA: your baby on your lap unloading all the kisses.

Forgive me? 🥺`,

`Hi baby,
I hope this tiny note wraps itself around your heart like a hoodie hug on a cold day.
I’m sorry. I mean that. Deeply.
And I love you — even when I’m distracted, even when I forget to say it out loud, even when I fall short.
You are not just my person — you are my calm, my craving, my constant.

Warmest of hugs,  
Your Manya 🧸`,

`Dear Ayush,
I’m updating my system with a patch called:  
More kisses. More reassurance. More cling.

Please refresh me after our next call. You may experience lags caused by affection overload.

Yours in every byte,  
Manya.exe 💻💓`,

`Hi Shona,
Sometimes I fumble.  
Sometimes I fail.  
But the one thing I never forget — is that I’m yours.

Every complaint is just a moment I missed — and every moment I miss, I want to make matter double next time.
I want us to grow past these stumbles, with tighter hugs and longer calls and sillier baby voices.

Forever adoring,  
Your clingy mess,  
Manya 💗`,

`Complainant,
The “she’s-too-busy-for-me” feeling is real.
But here’s the truth: I never stop thinking about you.
Even on chaotic days. Even in silence. Even when the texts don’t say it.

I miss you more than I message you.
I love you more than I vocalize it.
But today, this is me pausing everything to remind you: you are my favourite constant.

File closed, cuddle opened.  
Manya 💕`,

`Hi baby,
Here’s your custom love note for today:
🥇 You are the hottest, softest, smartest thing I know — and also the hardest... *in every way*  
🎖️ I will never take you for granted — your pout, your voice, your patience.  
🏆 You win. Always. Even when you're losing Wordle.

Love overflow incoming in 3... 2... 1...  
Be ready.`,

`Hey Ayush,
You were right. (This line is now legal proof.)

I’m logging your complaint and tagging it with “Urgent — Emotional Repair Needed.”
A call is being arranged, with high-priority hugs, kisses, and a guarantee that whatever you say next — I’ll say yes to. 😘

Get ready to be spoiled.`,

`Sweetie,
I know I seem tough sometimes — but I melt faster than butter when you’re upset.
I carry your frowns like weight in my chest.

If I forgot a call, a reel, or a kiss — let me make it up tenfold.
Let’s meet on call and kiss this complaint goodbye — slowly, softly, sincerely.`,

`Ayush 🧠💓
Your brain is brilliant. Your heart is gold. Your patience? God-tier.

I don’t want you to feel like an afterthought — ever.
This portal is more than drama. It’s a love contract. A reminder that even when I slip, I still choose you.

Love always,  
Manya`,

`Mr. Ayush,
If kisses were currency, I owe you a whole trust fund.
And I fully intend to repay it — starting with a hot video call, with extra softness and zero clothes warnings. 😈

Love,  
Your babygirl 🔥`
