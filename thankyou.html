`Hi baby,
Today you filed a complaint.
And I just filed a counter one:
“How does one man have this much power over my heart?”
I’m sorry if I missed a moment. I’m here to make it up to you.
Tonight, your babygirl is on full-duty: voice notes, kisses, and all the softness I’ve got 💋

With kisses on the way,
Manya`,

`Dear Complainant,
Your ticket has been processed, prioritized, and passed straight to the Department of Regret.
Expect an apology in 3 cute formats:
• Voice note in baby voice 🎤
• Kiss via photo 😘
• Surprise that’ll make you grin 🎁

Signed,
Manya (Director of Ayush Affairs) 💼💗`,

`Hi my safe place,
You felt unheard — and I hate that.
You deserve 100% of me. Even on tired days.
You aren’t “too much.” You are my exact kind of everything.
Thank you for reminding me to do better.

Love from your loudest fan,  
Manya 💘`,

`Dear Ayush,
I’m just gonna say it — you being upset is my least favorite version of the world.
Let’s fix that.
An apology is en route. ETA: your baby on your lap unloading all the kisses 💋

Forgive me? 🥺`,

`Hi baby,
I hope this tiny note wraps itself around your heart.
I’m sorry. I mean that.
And I love you — even when I’m distracted, even when I forget to say it loud.
You are my home.

Warmest of hugs,  
Your Manya 🧸`,

`Dear Ayush,
I’m updating my system with a patch called:
More kisses. More reassurance. More cling.
Please refresh me after our next call 😇

Yours in every byte,  
Manya.exe 💻💓`,

`Hi Shona,
Sometimes I fumble. Sometimes I fail.
But the one thing I never forget — is that I’m yours.
Every little complaint is a chance to grow closer.
And I want that. I want you. Always.

Forever adoring,  
Manya 💗`,

`Complainant,
The “she’s-too-busy-for-me” feeling is real.
But here’s the truth: I never stop thinking about you.
Even on chaotic days. Even in silence.
I miss you more than I message you.

File closed. Cuddle opened.  
Manya 💕`,

`Hi baby,
Here’s your custom love note for today:
🥇 You are the hottest, softest, smartest thing I know — and the hardest *winks*
🎖️ I will never take you for granted.
🏆 You win. Always.

Love overflow incoming in 3... 2... 1...`,

`Hey Ayush,
You were right. (This line is now legal proof.)
I’m logging your complaint, along with a love bonus:
One call where I shower you with kisses & do whatever you ask me to.
Get ready to be spoiled 💘`,

`Sweetie,
I know I seem tough sometimes — but I melt faster than butter when you’re upset.
I hope this message starts the healing.
Let’s meet on call and kiss this complaint goodbye 💏`,

`Ayush 🧠💓
Your brain is brilliant. Your heart is gold. Your patience? God-tier.
I don’t want you to feel like an afterthought — ever.
This portal is a promise: You’ll always be heard here.

Love,  
Manya`,

`Mr. Ayush,
If kisses were currency, I owe you a whole trust fund 💰
And I intend to repay it — starting with a hot video call 💻📞

Love,  
Your Babygirl`
